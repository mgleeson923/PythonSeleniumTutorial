# PythonSeleniumTutorial
Repo for the Udemy Tutorial I'm currently working through (Selenium WebDriver with Python 3.X)
https://www.udemy.com/course/selenium-webdriver-with-python3/
Starting very basic given I have little experience with Python Syntax. The hope is to move through the initial stuff fairly quickly so I can get into the Selenium portions of the tutorial. I'll be following this up with a second Automation Tutorial
